Designing a cohesive media experience for Android can be a lot of work. Telephoto aims to make that easier by offering some building blocks.

### [Zoomable Image](https://saket.github.io/telephoto/zoomableimage/)
_Drop-in_ replacement for `Image()` composables featuring support for pan & zoom gestures and automatic sub&#8209;sampling of large images that'd otherwise not fit into memory.

### [Modifier.zoomable()](https://saket.github.io/telephoto/zoomable/)
`ZoomableImage`'s gesture detector, packaged as a standalone `Modifier` that can be used with non-image composables.

See [project website](https://saket.github.io/telephoto) for full documentation.
