/**
 * [Modifier.zoomable] uses [ZoomableContentLocation] to understand the content's visual size and position
 * in order to prevent it from going out of bounds during pan & zoom gestures.
 *
 * The default value is [ZoomableContentLocation.SameAsLayoutBounds].
 *
 * [Modifier.zoomable] can't calculate this on its own by relying on the layout bounds of the content.
 * because they may be smaller or larger than the content's visual size. For example, an `Image` composable
 * that uses `Modifier.fillMaxSize()` could actually be drawing an image that only fills half its height.
 * Another example is a sub-sampled composable such as a map whose full sized content could be at an
 * order of magnitude larger than its layout bounds.
